    "A **modificação** consiste em enviar informações sobre a carga do sistema (_system workload_) em vez de informações sobre falhas que indicariam os processos suspeitos e não-suspeitos. Para isso, em vez de cada processo enviar mensagem do tipo `I'm p and I'm alive`, os processos enviarão a medição interna da sua carga de trabalho. \n",
    "\n",
    "Para simular a medição da carga de trabalho dos processos, utilize números aleatórios entre `0` e `1` com precisão de uma casa decimal apenas, por exemplo, `0.4`.\n",

    "Cada processo do sistema deverá ser implementado como um Julia Worker. O Master será apenas o gestor do experimento, ou seja, será responsável para criar os processos (Julia Workers) e iniciar o sistema. Uma vez iniciado, o sistema deve funcionar por si sem depender do Master; uma vez que o algoritmo é descentralizado.\n",
    "\n",
    "Para fins de visualização do monitoramento da carga de trabalho, os **Workers devem enviar ao Master** periodicamente (a cada `2` segundos) uma mensagem com o estado dos workers que eles monitoram (incluindo ele mesmo). Essa mensagem deve ser impresso na tela do master da seguinte forma.\n",

    "A última linha acima significa que as cargas de trabalho dos Workers monitorados pelo Worker 3 são `0.4,0.9,0.7`, ou seja, os Workers têm as seguintes carga de trabalho:\n",
